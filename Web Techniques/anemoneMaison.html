                        Nidle had the chance to collaborate with Dora Gaitanovici out of "pure coincidence" (I don't believe in coincidences). Similar visions, perspectives, same chaotic mind, all of these built the perfect team for working on a few unique pieces.

                    <p>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Artists inspire others. That's what Dora, Dante, Dani and Codruț do: they create, and love doing so. As much as "clothing doesn't matter", the way they dress enhances the way they make the public feel, depending on that they transmit.

                        The first piece of clothing we created together was a completely assymetrical web-like crocheted blouse, with a big pendant.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Made out of 100% cotton, the piece was structured, but flowy, with smaller and bigger holes in the fabric. One normal shorter sleeve, one longer split sleeve, the left part of the blouse longer than the right one - they all represent chaos, differences, just like humans - and like her album's "Descântec" puzzle pieces. The big pendant - a key - is "The Key of Longing", a repeating symbol in her songs.

                        Dora wanted me to keep the black from the previous garment, but also to add purple and silver for her second clothing piece (this time, a kind of symmetrical one), and so I did. The colorful yarn "cobweb" is hand sewn over a tulle cropped top (which I also sewed), and a part of the strands are twisted into long hanging braids.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This time, the focus was on adding the colours - purple and silver - in a balanced way. <i>I rarely find purple clothing pieces I can wear on stage. Do you think we can incorporate it here?</i>, <i>I love silver, maybe you can find a way to balance this colourway?</i> were her wishes.
