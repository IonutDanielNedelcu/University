                        Nidle already had a few opportunities, and missed none of them. Collaborating with artists and other brands, Nidle's vision does not stop here. The perfect word to describe what Nidle does is "individual".

                    <p>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Individual pieces (Nidle only creates limited edition products that you may never see again), individual characters (Nidle focuses on the personality and perspective of the artist or the collaborator), individual work (Nidle means me, and I mean Nidle. We are one and the same, the only difference is the perspective).

                            Dora Gaitanovici is a young, daring and complex musical project. After a viral episode on DWMT and participation in Eurovision, as well as the release of a concept album and national tours, Dora Gaitanovici managed to impress with electrifying performances at the biggest festivals in Romania, becoming the detached leaders of the new alternative wave in the country.

                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their sound combines elements of alternative, progressive and modern rock with slight folk influences. Dora's captivating voice, Dante's guitar virtuosity, Dani's harmonies and Codruț's groove, together with the complex productions and the energy transmitted in each live, define the Dora Gaitanovici project.

                            Prima Dragoste (eng. First Love), by her real name Alexandra Cebotar, is a Moldavian singer and songwriter. In high school, she studied piano and violin, period during which she composed her first song, "Scrisoare". A few months later, the second song "Portrete" followed; a piece that stood out in a larger audience thanks to it being featured in "Poliția muzicii", an online show created by Sebastian Coțofană.

                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Portrete" also reached the ears of the producers from Roton Music studios, who proposed Alexandra to take part in a recording session. Prima Dragoste emerged naturally as a way of expressing herself through music inspired by her own emotions and experiences.

                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Two years later, I bought my first crochet hook and skein of yarn (which were going to be my first enemy in my path of learning how to handcraft clothes, because I bought them not knowing the sizing system of the materials I needed).
                        </p>

                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For a few years, I crocheted as a casual activity, not even dreaming about it becoming such an important part of my life. At the end of 2019 things changed, and I started to crochet more and more, also picked up knitting, and I put myself in this river of creation that keeps growing.
